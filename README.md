# DIY RaspberryPi Pico Stream Deck

This is a macro keypad built with a Raspberry Pi Pico and 3D printed enclosure and keycaps intended to act as a homemade Stream Deck.

## Parts required

* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Cherry MX mechanical key switches
* Adafruit LED Sequins
* 3D printed enclosure

I ordered the majority of the parts, including the Pico, the LED Sequins, and the key switches, from https://www.adafruit.com.

I also 3D printed both the enclosure and the keycaps using slightly modified versions of the following designs from Thingiverse:

  I had to modify this enclosure design slightly because it was originally meant for a smaller Arduino, so it didn't fit the Raspberry Pi Pico.

  I slightly modified these keycaps to add a small gap at the bottom to all the LED to shine through.
  
## Putting it together

The first step is print the enclosure and insert the key switches into the faceplate.
