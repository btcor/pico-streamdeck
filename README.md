# DIY RaspberryPi Pico Stream Deck

This is a macro keypad built with a Raspberry Pi Pico and 3D printed enclosure and keycaps intended to act as a homemade Stream Deck.

## Parts required

* Raspberry Pi Pico
* Cherry MX mechanical key switches
* Adafruit LED Sequins
* 3D printed enclosure

I ordered the majority of the parts, including the Pico, the LED Sequins, and the key switches, from https://www.adafruit.com.

I also 3D printed both the enclosure and the keycaps using slightly modified versions of the following designs from Thingiverse:

  I had to modify this enclosure design slightly because it was originally meant for a smaller Arduino, so it didn't fit the Raspberry Pi Pico.

  I slightly modified these keycaps to add a small gap at the bottom to all the LED to shine through.
  
## Putting it together

The first step is to print the enclosure and insert the key switches into the faceplate.

The next step is to add the LED Sequins to the back of the key switches. These LEDs were actually originally intended by Adafruit to be used in wearable projects, such as cosplay, and can be sewn into fabric using conductive thread. However, I discovered that these small and easy to use LEDs fit perfectly into the little gap at the bottom the key switches. All you have to do is fit them into the gap at the bottom of the switch, add one drop of super glue to hold it in place, and the light will shine through the key.
